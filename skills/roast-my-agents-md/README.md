# roast-my-agents-md

Brutally honest AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md review — backed by real A/B test evidence, not just opinions. Built on [Anthropic's skill-creator](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/.claude/skills/skill-creator) eval framework.

Most AGENTS.md roasts are vibes. This one brings receipts.

## How It Works

1. **Static Roast** — Quick audit with comedy. Finds sins, calculates token tax, delivers zingers.
2. **Evidence Round** — Actually runs your rules through A/B tests. Proves which ones the model already follows without being told.
3. **The Verdict** — Scoreboard with real data. Guilty (dead weight) vs. Acquitted (actually useful).

## The Key Finding

In controlled testing, **25 of 26 assertions passed identically** with and without a 755-line instruction file. Most rules are redundant because the model discovers patterns from existing code. This skill proves exactly which of YOUR rules are dead weight.
